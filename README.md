# 50DayHardChallenge-Website

Website for the challenge, where the user can keep track of their activities during the day and make sure they do all the correct things. 
User can also check if he/she has done their activities throughout the 50days.


Not really focused on frontend, just a long simple CSS code mostly and some bootstrap. Frontend is mostly data generated.
