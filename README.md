# 50DayHardChallenge-Website

Website for the challenge, where the user can keep track of their activities during the day and make sure they do all the correct things. 
User can also check if he/she has done their activities throughout the 50days.

Made for a friend who mentioned he wanted to run this program, and I wanted a project to work on. 


Not really focused on frontend, used bootstrap. All text on the website is generated by AI.
